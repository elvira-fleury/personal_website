                        <h3>Derived Models in PFA</h3>
                        <p>  We discuss a conjecture of Wilson that under the proper forcing axiom,
$\Theta_0$ of the derived model at $\kappa$ is below $\kappa^+$. We prove the
conjecture holds for the old derived model. Assuming mouse capturing in the new
derived model, the conjecture holds there as well. We also show $\Theta <
\kappa^+$ in the case of the old derived model, and under additional hypotheses
for the new derived model.

                        <h3>Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Sensor for Perfluorooctanoic Acid
  Detection Using Two-dimensional Aluminium Quasicrystal</h3>
                        <p>  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred as "forever
chemicals," are pervasive environmental pollutants due to their resistance to
degradation. Among these, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) poses significant
threats to human health, contaminating water sources globally. Here, we have
demonstrated the potential of a novel electrochemical sensor based on
two-dimensional (2D) aluminium-based multicomponent quasicrystals (2D-Al QC)
for the ultrasensitive sub-picomolar level detection of PFOA. The 2D-Al
QC-inked electrode was employed here to detect PFOA by differential pulse
voltammetry (DPV). The limit of detection (LoD) achieved is 0.59 +/- 0.05 pM.
The sensor was evaluated for selectivity with other interfering compounds,
repeatability of cycles, and reproducibility for five similar electrodes with a
deviation of 0.8 %. The stability of the sensor has also been analysed after
ninety days ,which shows a minimal variation of 15%. Spectroscopic techniques
and theoretical calculations were further utilized to understand the
interaction between the 2D-Al QC and PFOA. The results demonstrate that the
2D-Al QC offers a promising platform for the rapid and sensitive detection of
PFOA, potentially addressing current environmental monitoring challenges.

                        <h3>Improved Feature Generating Framework for Transductive Zero-shot
  Learning</h3>
                        <p>  Feature Generative Adversarial Networks have emerged as powerful generative
models in producing high-quality representations of unseen classes within the
scope of Zero-shot Learning (ZSL). This paper delves into the pivotal influence
of unseen class priors within the framework of transductive ZSL (TZSL) and
illuminates the finding that even a marginal prior bias can result in
substantial accuracy declines. Our extensive analysis uncovers that this
inefficacy fundamentally stems from the utilization of an unconditional unseen
discriminator - a core component in existing TZSL. We further establish that
the detrimental effects of this component are inevitable unless the generator
perfectly fits class-specific distributions. Building on these insights, we
introduce our Improved Feature Generation Framework, termed I-VAEGAN, which
incorporates two novel components: Pseudo-conditional Feature Adversarial (PFA)
learning and Variational Embedding Regression (VER). PFA circumvents the need
for prior estimation by explicitly injecting the predicted semantics as pseudo
conditions for unseen classes premised by precise semantic regression.
Meanwhile, VER utilizes reconstructive pre-training to learn class statistics,
obtaining better semantic regression. Our I-VAEGAN achieves state-of-the-art
TZSL accuracy across various benchmarks and priors. Our code would be released
upon acceptance.

                        <h3>MambaPro: Multi-Modal Object Re-Identification with Mamba Aggregation
  and Synergistic Prompt</h3>
                        <p>  Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to retrieve specific objects
by utilizing complementary image information from different modalities.
Recently, large-scale pre-trained models like CLIP have demonstrated impressive
performance in traditional single-modal object ReID tasks. However, they remain
unexplored for multi-modal object ReID. Furthermore, current multi-modal
aggregation methods have obvious limitations in dealing with long sequences
from different modalities. To address above issues, we introduce a novel
framework called MambaPro for multi-modal object ReID. To be specific, we first
employ a Parallel Feed-Forward Adapter (PFA) for adapting CLIP to multi-modal
object ReID. Then, we propose the Synergistic Residual Prompt (SRP) to guide
the joint learning of multi-modal features. Finally, leveraging Mamba's
superior scalability for long sequences, we introduce Mamba Aggregation (MA) to
efficiently model interactions between different modalities. As a result,
MambaPro could extract more robust features with lower complexity. Extensive
experiments on three multi-modal object ReID benchmarks (i.e., RGBNT201,
RGBNT100 and MSVR310) validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The
source code is available at https://github.com/924973292/MambaPro.

                        <h3>Probabilistic Finite Automaton Emptiness is Undecidable for a Fixed
  Automaton</h3>
                        <p>  We construct a probabilistic finite automaton (PFA) with 7 states and an
input alphabet of 5 symbols for which the PFA Emptiness Problem is undecidable.
The only input for the decision problem is the starting distribution. For the
proof, we use reductions from special instances of the Post Correspondence
Problem.
  We also consider some variations: The input alphabet of the PFA can be
restricted to a binary alphabet at the expense of a larger number of states. If
we allow a rational output value for each state instead of a yes-no acceptance
decision, the number of states can even be reduced to 6.
